This repository contains a few sample scenes that demonstrate the basic functionality of YarnSpinner-Godot. 

Clone this project and open it as a Godot project. Enabled the Plugin as described on the [Installation](./Installation.md) page. 

You can then open the sample scenes  under `Samples/` and run them to see a demonstration of the functionality. 

# Space 

The space sample is a simple dialogue sample which shows a player sprite moving throughout a small level, pressing the space key to interact with two characters, Sally and Computer. It demonstrates how to have different logic when re-entering a dialogue node, and yarn commands. The .yarn files also contain examples of `<<declare>>` statements which can optionally declare a yarn variable at compile time. 

# Visual Novel

This is an example of a dialogue-focused game such as a visual novel, which animates sprites and plays sound effects and music to reinforce the dramatic thrust of the scene. It does so by use of Yarn Commands.  It also displays a demonstration of how to set up localization for a base language (in this case, English) and two other languages. Please note that this sample uses a very rough machine translation so the Japanese and Spanish text may not be correct.
